            <h2>Steve Jobs</h2>
            <p><b>Steven Paul Jobs</b> was an American inventor, designer and entrepreneur who was the co-founder, 
                chief executive and chairman of Apple Computer. 
                Apple's revolutionary products, which include the iPod, 
                iPhone and iPad, are now seen as dictating the evolution of modern technology. <br><br>
                Born in 1955 to two University of Wisconsin graduate students who gave him up for adoption, 
                Jobs was smart but directionless, dropping out of college and experimenting with 
                different pursuits before co-founding Apple with Steve Wozniak in 1976. 
                Jobs left the company in 1985, launching Pixar Animation Studios, 
                then returned to Apple more than a decade later. Jobs died in 2011 following a 
                long battle with pancreatic cancer. </p>

            <h2>Surprising Facts About Steve Jobs</h2>
        </header>
        <div class="facts-background">
            <div class="facts-text">
                <ul>
                    <li>Steve Jobs was adopted shortly after being born.</li>
                    <li>Jobs was, biologically, half Arab. His biological father was Syrian and his mother was American.</li>
                    <li>Jobs's biological parents had one mandate--that Jobs be adopted by two college-educated people. The biological parents found out that neither Clara nor Paul Jobs had ever graduated from college, but the adoption went through when it was promised that Steve Jobs would receive a university education (funny considering that Jobs went on to become a college dropout).</li>
                    <li>Jobs and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak met in high school--Wozniak was 18 and Jobs was just 13.</li>
                    <li>Jobs was a pescetarian, meaning he ate no meat except for fish.</li>
                    <li>He was an official college dropout, but continued his education by informally auditing classes.</li>
                    <li>One class Jobs audited was a calligraphy course, which he says was instrumental in the future Apple products' attention to typography and font.</li>
                    <li>Jobs was pushed out of his own company in 1985. Despite the fallout, he later recognized the coup as a blessing in disguise, as it gave him a chance to experiment creatively and purchase an animation studio, which would later be known as Pixar. Eventually he rejoined Apple as CEO in 1997 (and revitalized the failing company).</li>
                    <li>Jobs had an entire team devoted to packaging who studied the experience of opening a box to learn how to achieve the excitement and emotional response that is now common with Apple products.</li>
                    <li>Jobs was found to have pancreatic cancer in 2003, but rather than taking the doctor-recommended path of immediate operation, Jobs subscribed to an alternative-medicine regimen, including a vegan diet, acupuncture, and herbal remedies, even consulting a psychic.</li>
                    <li>After nine months, Jobs gave in and underwent surgery. Many consider the delay a major factor in his eventual decline.</li>
                    <li>His last words on his deathbed were, "Oh wow, oh wow, oh wow," while gazing over his family's shoulders.</li>
